## Overview

<a href="#">Mocha Pro 2022</a> delivers Academy Award-winning tracking technology through an interface refined over years of professional production use. This software has become the industry standard for planar tracking, rotoscoping, and object removal, used on virtually every major Hollywood production and countless television shows, commercials, and music videos. The technology earned recognition with an Academy Award for its contribution to visual effects, and continues evolving to address the most challenging post-production scenarios.

<a href="#">Planar tracking</a> represents Mocha's core innovation and the foundation for all its tools. Unlike point trackers that follow individual features, planar tracking analyzes how entire surfaces move through perspective changes. This approach proves far more robust when individual features become occluded, move off-frame, or change appearance. The algorithm identifies planes in footage and calculates their transformation through shear, rotation, scale, and perspective changes. This data then drives compositing, rotoscoping, and stabilization with unprecedented accuracy.

The <a href="#">planar surface</a> concept extends beyond obvious flat objects. Walls, floors, sides of vehicles, human torsos, and even slightly curved surfaces all exhibit planar motion characteristics that Mocha can track. The tracker handles partial occlusions by analyzing visible portions of tracked surfaces. Multiple planar layers can be tracked simultaneously, with Mocha automatically handling their depth relationships. This flexibility enables tracking scenarios that defeat simpler tools.

<a href="#">Rotoscoping tools</a> in Mocha Pro combine freehand drawing with spline mathematics for efficient matte creation. The X-Spline and Bezier tools create smooth, controllable shapes. Magnetic spline options snap to edges automatically, accelerating initial shape creation. The layer-based workflow organizes complex roto tasks, while the timeline provides keyframe control over shape changes. Mocha's rotoscoping benefits enormously from its tracking foundation, as tracked shapes follow motion automatically.

<a href="#">Shape behavior</a> options determine how roto shapes respond to tracking data. Link to Track mode connects shapes to specific tracked surfaces, so shapes follow motion automatically. The animator only needs to adjust shapes when the subject's outline changes relative to the tracked surface. This dramatically reduces keyframe requirements compared to frame-by-frame rotoscoping. Multiple shapes can link to different tracked layers for complex subjects.

The <a href="#">Remove module</a> automates object removal through temporal frame analysis. Rather than requiring clean plates, Remove analyzes footage over time to reconstruct backgrounds behind unwanted objects. The tracked matte defines what to remove, and Remove fills the area with appropriate background content. The module handles moving cameras and dynamic backgrounds that would be impossible to paint out manually. Foreground holdouts prevent important elements from being removed.

<a href="#">Clean Plate workflow</a> in the Remove module enables hybrid approaches. Artists can provide painted clean plates for specific frames, and Remove interpolates between them for surrounding frames. This handles situations where automatic removal needs guidance. The clean plate can be created directly in Mocha or painted externally. Progressive refinement enables starting with automatic removal and adding clean plates only where needed.

<a href="#">Stabilization</a> in Mocha Pro provides multiple modes for different needs. Smooth options reduce shake while preserving intentional camera motion. Lock modes eliminate all motion for rock-solid footage. Geometry stabilization handles perspective changes that shift-based stabilizers cannot correct. The stabilization data can export to host applications for processing there, or render can happen directly within Mocha.

The <a href="#">3D camera solver</a> extracts actual camera motion from footage for proper CGI integration. The solver analyzes tracked planar surfaces to calculate camera position, rotation, and lens characteristics over time. This data exports in formats compatible with major 3D applications and compositing software. The resulting camera move enables CGI elements to be added that match the original photography precisely. Adjustable solve parameters handle various footage characteristics.

<a href="#">Lens module</a> analyzes and corrects lens distortion for accurate tracking and effects work. Wide-angle and anamorphic distortion gets measured and removed, enabling clean tracking of warped footage. The correction can be applied permanently or used non-destructively within the tracking pipeline. Lens data exports for use in other applications, ensuring consistent distortion handling throughout the pipeline.

<a href="#">Insert module</a> renders tracked graphics directly within Mocha. Imported images or video get corner-pinned onto tracked surfaces with appropriate motion blur and mesh warping. This enables quick preview of graphics replacements without exporting to other applications. The insert can account for lens distortion and lighting changes for integrated results. Multiple inserts can be rendered in a single pass for efficiency.

<a href="#">PowerMesh</a> tracking extends planar tracking to deforming surfaces. The tool creates a mesh of planar sub-surfaces that can flex and stretch while maintaining overall tracking coherence. This handles organic surfaces like faces, fabric, and skin that simple planar tracking cannot follow. PowerMesh data can drive warped rotoscope shapes and texture replacements on deforming surfaces.

<a href="#">Export options</a> send Mocha data to virtually any professional application. Format support includes After Effects, Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Nuke, Flame, Fusion, and many more. Different export types cover tracking data, shapes, rendered elements, and camera solves. The plugin versions enable working directly within host applications, while standalone Mocha offers the complete interface for complex projects.

<a href="#">GPU acceleration</a> enables interactive performance with complex projects. Tracking, removal, and rendering all benefit from GPU processing. Metal implementation on macOS maximizes Apple Silicon performance. The acceleration transforms workflow by enabling real-time feedback during challenging operations. Preview rendering happens in the background without blocking other work.
